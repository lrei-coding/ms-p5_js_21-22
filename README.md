# Creative Coding

## LREI -- Middle School -- 2021-2022, Trimester 1

The Creative Coding class engages our students in a hands-on exploration and practice in learning coding by building an interactive web site. This class covers JavaScript using the p5.js library. Students learn the core concepts of coding with this language. Students put this knowledge into practice by coding an interactive website of their own and sharing it with others.

This class also creates a great space for the students to discuss many topics of interest regarding Information Technology. Students discuss and explore timely topics in security, privacy, managed systems, and much more.
